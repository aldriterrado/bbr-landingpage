# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the BBR Landing Page project to improve loading speed and reduce lag.

## üöÄ Key Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
- **Lazy Loading**: All section components are now lazy-loaded using React.lazy()
- **Code Splitting**: Sections are loaded only when needed, reducing initial bundle size
- **Suspense Boundaries**: Added loading fallbacks for better user experience

### 2. Event Handler Optimization
- **Throttled Scroll Events**: Scroll handlers are throttled to ~60fps (16ms intervals)
- **Throttled Mouse Events**: Mouse move handlers are throttled to prevent excessive updates
- **Passive Event Listeners**: Added `{ passive: true }` for better scroll performance

### 3. React Performance Improvements
- **React.memo**: Used for OptimizedSection component to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **useCallback**: Memoized event handlers and functions to prevent recreation
- **useMemo**: Memoized expensive calculations and object creations
- **Optimized Re-renders**: Reduced unnecessary state updates and DOM manipulations

### 4. Intersection Observer
- **Visibility Detection**: Sections only render when they become visible
- **Lazy Rendering**: Content is loaded progressively as user scrolls
- **Memory Management**: Better memory usage by not rendering off-screen content

### 5. Build Optimizations
- **Chunk Splitting**: Vendor libraries are split into separate chunks
- **Tree Shaking**: Unused code is eliminated during build
- **Asset Optimization**: Better file naming and organization

## üìä Performance Improvements

### Before Optimization:
- All sections loaded immediately on page load
- Scroll events firing on every pixel movement
- Mouse events firing continuously
- No code splitting or lazy loading
- Heavy initial bundle size

### After Optimization:
- Sections load progressively as needed
- Scroll events throttled to 60fps
- Mouse events throttled for smooth performance
- Code splitting reduces initial load time
- Intersection Observer for smart rendering

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Performance Utilities (`src/utils/performance.ts`)
```typescript
// Throttle function for performance
export function throttle<T extends (...args: any[]) => any>(func: T, delay: number): T

// Debounce function for performance  
export function debounce<T extends (...args: any[]) => any>(func: T, delay: number): T

// Optimized scroll handler
export function createScrollHandler(callback: () => void, delay: number = 16)
```

### Optimized Section Wrapper (`src/components/OptimizedSection.tsx`)
- Uses React.memo for performance
- Intersection Observer for visibility detection
- Progressive rendering based on scroll position

### Lazy Loading Implementation
```typescript
// Lazy load sections for better performance
const Section1 = lazy(() => import('./components/section/Section1').then(module => ({ default: module.Section1 })))
const Section2 = lazy(() => import('./components/section/Section2').then(module => ({ default: module.Section2 })))
// ... etc
```

## üìà Expected Results

- **Initial Load Time**: 30-50% reduction
- **Scroll Performance**: Smooth 60fps scrolling
- **Memory Usage**: Reduced memory footprint
- **User Experience**: Faster perceived performance
- **Bundle Size**: Smaller initial JavaScript bundle

## üîß Usage

### Development
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run type-check   # Type checking
npm run lint         # Linting
```

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build        # Production build
npm run build:analyze # Build with analysis
npm run preview      # Preview production build
```

## üìù Best Practices Applied

1. **Event Throttling**: Prevent excessive function calls
2. **Memoization**: Cache expensive calculations
3. **Lazy Loading**: Load code only when needed
4. **Intersection Observer**: Efficient visibility detection
5. **Code Splitting**: Reduce initial bundle size
6. **Passive Listeners**: Better scroll performance
7. **React.memo**: Prevent unnecessary re-renders

## üö® Performance Monitoring

Monitor these metrics to ensure optimizations are working:
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Bundle size and chunk distribution

## üîÆ Future Optimizations

- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Service Worker for caching
- Critical CSS inlining
- Preload critical resources
- WebP image format support
- CDN implementation
